EK125 - Final Project

Traveling is the way in which we see the world, and how we want to experience different styles of life. This is the reason why traveling is so popular. The travel and tourism's direct industry gross domestic product (GDP) represents nearly 3.1% of global GDP and it still has the capability of generating more value (i.e. creating employment, enhancing regional cooperation, etc.) However, travelers always have problems finding their ideal destination. Our project is to help these travelers to find their ideal country to travel to. 

Unfortunately, as the world's air condition is worsening due to industrialization, traveling can be more challenging especially for people who suffer from pulmonary conditions. Moreover, if you are worried about your lungs, the air quality of the location to which you are traveling can make a big difference to travelers overall traveling enjoyment. Our project embeds datasets of PM2.5 amounts in varied countries and lets users choose whether they favor for traveling in countries with better air cleanness or not. 

Furthermore, the popularity of traveling destinations is another essential prerequisite for an overall enjoyable traveling experience. More people traveling to a place, more travel reviews will be available and travel routines will be explored. Our project also includes datasets for overnight travelers in varied counties and lets users choose whether they favor for traveling in countries with higher popularity or not.
